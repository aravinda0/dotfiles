# This file is sourced at the start of the X session, before the window manager is
# started. This is where we set any GUI-related environment variables.
#
# For example, we can set Qt/GTK/etc hidpi scaling variables so that any application
# launched through our window manager can see those variables. Window managers like
# qtile spawn commands via `/bin/sh` so anything we set in our shell startup files won't
# be seen.
